      <h1>A Children's Author</h1>
      <h5>In September 2013, Suzanne released a critically acclaimed autobiographical picture book, Year of the Jungle, illustrated by James Proimos. It deals with the year she was six and her father was deployed to Vietnam. It has been sold into 12 territories in 11 languages. </h5>
      <h5>Her first picture book, When Charlie Mcbutton Lost Power, about a boy obsessed with computer games, was illustrated by Mike Lester and came out in 2005. It has been sold into 4 foreign territories.</h5>
      <h2>Year of the Jungle</h2>
      <p>A deeply moving autobiographical picture book about a father who must go off to the war in Vietnam -- and the daughter who stays behind. </p>
      <p>When young Suzy's father leaves for Vietnam, she struggles to understand what this means for her and her family. What is the jungle like? Will her father be safe? When will he return? The months slip by, marked by the passing of the familiar holidays and the postcards that her father sends. With each one, he feels more and more distant, until Suzy isn't sure she'd even recognize her father anymore. </p>

    <h2>When Charlie Mcbutton Lost Power</h2>
    <p>A boy who likes nothing but playing computer games is in trouble when the power goes out and his little sister has all of the batteries in the house. </p>
    <p>Charlie McButton likes computer games so much, he never plays with anything else. When a thunderstorm knocks out the electricity, his tech empire comes tumbling down, and his whole world loses power. Charlie needs batteries FAST! But the only triple- A's he can find are in his little sister's talking doll. </p>
    <p>Will he resort to desperate measures and cause his sister to have a meltdown of her own? Or will he snap out of his computer craze long enough to realize his sister might be fun, even if she doesn't come with batteries? </p>
    <p>Collins and Lester team up for a hilarious and timely tale that will crack up young computer addicts and those who love them!</p>

    <blockquote>
      <h2>Q&amp;A with Suzanne</h2>
      <p><strong>Q: Of all the places Gregor could have traveled to, why the Underland?</strong></p>
      A: I liked the fact that this world was teeming under New York City and nobody was aware of it. That you could be going along preoccupied with your own problems and then whoosh! You take a wrong turn in your laundry room and suddenly a giant cockroach is right in your face. No magic, no space or time travel, there’s just a ticket to another world behind your clothes dryer. 
      <p><strong>Q: Is there anything you find/found difficult or challenging in writing from the perspective of an 11-year-old boy?</strong></p>
      A: I remember being 11 very clearly and I had a lot of friends who were boys so it felt pretty natural being in Gregor’s head. 
      <p><strong>Q: Are you anything like Gregor?</strong></p>
      A: I think I’m like Gregor because we both want to do the right thing but sometimes have trouble figuring out what it is. Also, neither of us likes to ride roller coasters and we’ve both changed a lot of diapers. But Gregor is much braver than I am…if I even see a regular sized rat in New York City I immediately cross the street. 
      <p><strong>Q: Are you kinder to cockroaches, bats, rats, and/or spiders nowadays?</strong></p>
      A: I don’t think I was ever particularly unkind to them, but I do have more of a connection with them now. I’m more aware of their similarities to humans. And I’m sympathetic to their desire to survive, which all creatures share. 
      <p><strong>Q: Did you have a sibling who, like Boots, got you into a world of trouble?</strong></p>
      A: I have two older sisters and one older brother and hold them largely responsible for the trouble I got into growing up. I believe as the youngest child, that is my right.
      <p><strong>Q: Have you ever been lost and wanted to find your way home?</strong></p>
A: All the time. I have a terrible sense of direction. I get lost practically every time I leave my house. Fortunately, people are usually very kind about giving you directions if you ask politely. </blockquote>
