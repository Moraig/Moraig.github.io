      <h1>Underland Chronicles</h1>
      <p>When 11-year-old Gregor follows his little sister Boots through a grate in the laundry room of their New York apartment building, he discovers a vast, dark Underland beneath the city.</p>
      <p>It’s a gloomy yet strangely beautiful place where humans have learned to live without the sun, and giant cockroaches, bats, and rats have learned to speak. The humans are influenced by the prophecies of their ancestral leader, Bartholomew of Sandwich, whose words foretell the coming of a Warrior from above who will save the Underland from a variety of perilous situations. </p>
      <p>Is Gregor that Warrior? And does he care enough about the Underland to risk his life for it? </p>

        <h2><img src="images/1.png" alt="" width="199" height="246" class="uc-effect"/>Gregor the Overlander</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minute he lands in the Underland for the first time, Gregor is desperate to get home. However, an unexpected quest forces Gregor and his little sister Boots to explore this strange world and befriend some of its unusual inhabitants. Because according to “The Prophecy of Grey,” Gregor may be able to save the Underlanders from destruction and find someone he thought he lost long ago.</p>

    <img src="images/2.jpg" alt="" width="142" height="174" class="side_para_margin uc-effect img-center"/>
    <p class="side_para_margin">Back in New York City, months after his first adventure, Gregor has vowed never to return to the Underland. But the Underlanders need his help again. “The Prophecy of Bane” has come to pass, which means Gregor and Boots must set off on another quest — &nbsp;this time to find and kill an ominous white- coated rat called the Bane before the gnawers kill Boots.</p>

  <p class="side_para_margin">A terrible plague has broken out in the Underland, as foretold in “The Prophecy of Blood.” Luckily, the prophecy also states that Gregor and a band of questers can find the cure deep in the Jungle. But this time, Gregor’s mother refuses to let him and Boots go . . . until Ripred the rat makes her an offer she can’t refuse. As Gregor’s worlds collide, his fate becomes even more entangled with that of the Underlanders.</p>
